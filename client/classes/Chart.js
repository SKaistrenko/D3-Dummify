     * the code related with the graph being displayed on page. This would
     * trigger another re-render, so we need to tell the component NOT

     * 
     * 2) When the user clicks and drags on the color picker, it changes
     * the props many times. This calls the plotGraph function too
     * frequently, so we need to debounce it so it only gets called, at
     * max, once every 100ms.
